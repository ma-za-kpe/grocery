# grocery

- Create a form that allows a user to input items they need at the store.
- When the user submits the form, hide the form and display the list of items in alphabetical order, all uppercased.
- Hint: To do this, build an array of the inputted items. (Make sure you don't include any blank fields.) Sort the array in alphabetical order. Make a new array with each entry uppercased (don't just uppercase them when you display them). Then, display the sorted list of things as list items inside a <ul>.

Explore the arrays entry of the Mozilla Developer Network JavaScript documentation to research what method might be used to sort arrays.
